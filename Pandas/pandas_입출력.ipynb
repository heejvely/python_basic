raised.\\r\\n\\r\\n It might be confusing for someone trying to groupby on columns and index (that is not aware `by `can actually perform this).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI think a cleaner error should be raised, like \\r\\n\\r\\n`ValueError: groupby only accepts one of \\'by\\' or \\'level\\' parameters.`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed

`values = values[~isnaobj(values)]`, just pass `skipna` to the relevant validator functions.  This causes trouble because those validator functions have different rules about what NA values they allow (analogous to is_valid_na_for_dtype).\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m down to 1 test case failing locally, fixing it will require changing the StringArray constructor to allow None and np.nan (xref #40839) in addition to just pd.NA (AFAICT pd.array and pd.Series(... dtype=\"string\") will not be affected).

provide information, and allow discussion, on the NumFOCUS small development grant to improve benchmarks for pandas (and possibly other projects of the ecosystem). The content of this issue is work in progress, and will be updated as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nList of some of the tasks identified to improve asv itself:\\r\\n- Evaluate the need of forking [asv](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv), and fork if needed. The project looks abandoned, and maintainers have been contacted, but no answer yet.\\r\\n- Update the style of asv (codebase currently is not following PEP-8), and [remove Python 2 compatibility code](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv/issues/909) (and `six` dependency)\\r\\n- Evaluate if it make sense to [allow asv to be imported in benchmarks](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv/issues/908), and possibly implement it\\r\\n- Evaluate and possibly implement API changes to asv, to improve readability, usability and code clarity. For example, would it be a good idea to provide an abstract base class for benchmarks?\\r\\n- Evaluate using [conbench](https://github.com/conbench/conbench) or [codespeed](https://github.com/tobami/codespeed) as the UI for benchmarks, and possibly make asv compatible with one or more external UI's, and drop asv UI\\r\\n- Find code not in use anymore, and remove it\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on the pandas benchmarks:\\r\\n- Make benchmarks run faster, analyzing slower benchmarks, and by using less data when make sense, or avoiding unnecessary parametrizations\\r\\n- Improve the CI for pandas benchmarks. Making them more reliable (we're currently using a `grep` to see if the build has failed). We can also check if the logs can be improved\\r\\n- Review benchmark structure, see if it can be improved so benchmarks are easier to find, and remove duplicate benchmarks if it makes sense\\r\\n- Review [existing bechmarks issues](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABenchmark), discuss with the pandas team on any that should be prioritizes, and work on the important ones\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on infrastructure:\\r\\n- Evaluate options to replace the [current pandas benchmarks infrastructure](https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/pandas/) and coordinate with NumFOCUS\\r\\n- Add hooks and notifications that make sense to detect performance regressions as soon as possible\\r\\n\\r\\nList of some other projects using

separate issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, on the specific datetime -> integer deprecation:\\r\\n\\r\\n- I find it a bit strange to deprecate/disallow it for `astype`, but then point people to the `view` instead. There are usecases where you need the integers (eg if you want to do some custom rounding, or need to feed it to a system that requires unix time as integers, ...), and personally I would rather have users go to `astype` than `view` (because `astype` is the more standard method for this, + _if_ we would go with copy-on-write, this gets a bit a strange method ...)  \\r\\n  In addition, using `view` will actually error for non-equal size bitwidth (`astype` actually as well, but that's something we can change, while for `view` that is inherent to the method). And `view` can also silently overflow if converting to uint64, while for `astype` we could check for that. In general, I see `view` as an advanced method you should only use if you really know what you are doing (and in general you don't really need in pandas, I think) \\r\\n- There is no ambiguity around what the expected result would be IMO (for naive datetimes / timedelta)\\r\\n- The other way around (integer -> datetime / timedelta) is not deprecated\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is then some follow-up discussion in the issue below https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/22384#issuecomment-921024358\\r\\n\\r\\nI would personally propose to keep allowing `astype()` for datetime64 -> int64, and not steer users to `view()` for this.\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @jbrockmendel\",\n","  'closed_at': None,\n","  'comments': 6,\n","  'comments_url':
